## Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> You can buy rotating proxies here: [WebShare](https://www.webshare.io/?referral_code=eh8mkj0b6ral) (I get a small cut from that link so please use it if you want to support my work). I would advice you to get the "Verified Proxy" Plan and to take 100 proxy server with 1000 GB/month Bandwidth which is 7.07$/month, but i would highly suggest you take the 250 proxy server and 5000GB plan ($25.73 per month) if you want to have a good speed and avoid skipping items the most you can.
- Docker installed (https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Some knowledge with Docker, JS and MongoDB
- Git installed (optional)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository from terminal or download through Github.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teddy-vltn/vinted-discord-bot.git
cd vinted-monitor
```

2. Create a Discord bot in Discord's Developer Portal and invite it to your server:

- Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Click on "New Application" and give your bot a name.
- Go to the "Bot" tab and click on "Add Bot".
- Copy the "Client ID" and "Token" and paste them into the `.env` file.
- Give intent permissions to the bot by going to the "Bot" tab and enabling the "Presence Intent", "Server Members Intent" and "Content Message Intent".
- Invite the bot with admin permissions to your server by going to the "OAuth2" tab and selecting the "bot" and "application.commands" scope and the "Administrator" permission.
- Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

3. Modify the configuration file `.env` to match your setup by modifying the remaining fields.

4. Make sure you have docker installed on your machine or [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and run the following command:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are on Windows, make sure you have WSL2 alongside Docker Desktop to run the following command. You will also certainly need to activate virtualization in your BIOS.

Make sure the start.sh has permission to execute.
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```

```bash
./start.sh
```

5. The bot should now be running and ready to use. And enjoy! (if it ain't working you can come to the discord server for help https://discord.gg/CDv9b8cPXU)

?. If you want to stop the bot, you can run the following command:

Make sure the stop.sh has permission to execute.

```bash
chmod +x stop.sh
```

```bash
./stop.sh
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If along the way you happen to modify the `.env` file or files in the other folders, you will need to rebuild the docker image by stopping the containers and to start them again.
